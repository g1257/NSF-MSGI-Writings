	We will explore the connection between statistical mechanics models and quantum Hamiltonians, primarily via examples. 
	
	More stuff here later. Basic objects/definitions.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\section{Ising Models}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	The Ising models are a family of statistical mechanics models with nearest-neighbor interaction. 
	Given any lattice $\cL \subset \Z^d$ with $N$ total points, define a \emph{spin} at each site of the lattice via a variable $s \in \Omega_0=\{\pm 1\}$. 
	A \emph{configuration} is a collection $\{s\}=\{s_\ell\}_{\ell\in\cL}$. 
	For convenience, we will usually work with cubic lattices of the form $\cL=\{-n,-n+1,\ldots, n-1,n\}^d$ and impose periodic boundary conditions. 
	The \emph{action} associated to this model is the function 
	\[\mathcal{S}(\{s\},\tau)=-\beta_\tau(\tau)\sum_{i\sim j} s_is_j - \beta(\tau)h\sum_{i}s_i , \] 
	where $\tau$ is the lattice spacing in the ``time" direction, $h$ is the strength of an external magnetic field, and the first sum is over nearest neighbor sites of the lattice. 
	The coefficients $\beta_\tau$ and $\beta$ may depend on the time direction lattice spacing and are otherwise chosen to reflect some physical situation (e.g. they may be taken to be proportional to the ``inverse temperature" $\frac{1}{kT}$ where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant).
	
	We will be interested in the \emph{partition function} $Z$ defined as \[Z=\sum_{\{s\}\in\Omega_0^N}e^{-\mathcal{S}(\{s\},\tau)}. \]
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{1+0 Ising}
	
	In the 1+0 Ising model, we take a 1-dimensional statistical mechanics system and relate it to a 0-dimensional (point) quantum Hamiltonian. See \cite{FradkinSusskind78} and \cite{KogutGaugeSummary}.
	The definitions above simplify to the following. The lattice is now a set of $N$ points $x_0,\ldots,x_{N-1}$ on a circle so that $s_0=s_N$. The action is given by 
	\[\mathcal{S}(\{s\},\tau)=-\beta_\tau(\tau)\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} s_is_{i+1} - \beta(\tau)h\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}s_i. \] 
	It will be helpful to rewrite this expression to be symmetric and expressed in terms of sums and differences of the $s_i$. 
	Up to a constant factor of $-\beta_\tau\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}s_i$, we find
	 \[\mathcal{S}(\{s\},\tau)=\frac{1}{2}\beta_\tau(\tau)\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (s_i-s_{i+1})^2 - \frac{1}{2}\beta(\tau)h\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}(s_i+s_{i+1}). \]
	Note that we needed periodicity in order to rewrite the second term in this way. Further, we now have $\mathcal{S}=0$ when all of the spins are identical and $h=0$.
	
	Now the partition function becomes 
	\begin{align*}
		Z&=\sum_{\{s\}\in\Omega_0^N} e^{\frac{1}{2}\beta_\tau(\tau)\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (s_i-s_{i+1})^2 - \frac{1}{2}\beta(\tau)h\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}(s_i+s_{i+1})} \\
		&=\sum_{s_0 \in \{\pm 1\}} \ldots \sum_{s_{N-1}\in \{\pm 1\}} e^{\frac{1}{2}\beta_\tau (s_0-s_1)^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\beta h(s_0+s_1)}\cdot\ldots\cdot e^{\frac{1}{2}\beta_\tau (s_{N-1}-s_0)^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\beta h(s_{N-1}+s_0)}.
	\end{align*}
	
	However, each factor in the product depends only on what the values of $s_i-s_{i+1}$ and $s_i+s_{i+1}$ are. 
	We can construct the \emph{transfer matrix}, $T$, to record this data, indexed by the possible spins at each site.
	So we have 
	\[T_{-1,-1}=e^{-\beta h}, \quad T_{-1,1}=T_{1,-1}=e^{-2\beta_\tau}, \quad \text{and}\ T_{1,1}=e^{\beta h}. \] 
	Thus \[T=\begin{bmatrix}
	e^{-\beta h} & e^{-2\beta_\tau} \\
	e^{-2\beta_\tau} & e^{\beta h}
	\end{bmatrix}. \]
	
	Now we can write $Z=\Tr T^N$. 
	%TODO: expand on this claim
		
	%TODO: Should I insert more of the action formalism/statisical mechanics stuff here for this model before moving to the Hamiltonian?
	Our goal is to choose functions $\beta_\tau(\tau)$ and $\beta(\tau)$ so that the transfer matrix operator $T$ has the form $T=e^{-\tau H} \approx I-\tau H$ for some quantum Hamiltonian $H$ (independent of $\tau$) acting on a $2$-dimensional vector space. 
	This is the \emph{$\tau$-continuum Hamiltonian} for the model. 
	Here the idea is that statistical mechanics properties of the lattice action system (e.g. magnetization per site, average magnetization, two-point correlations, correlation length) will map to properties of the operator $H$ related to its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
	
	For example, we could choose $\beta_\tau(\tau)=-\frac{1}{2}\log \tau$ and $\beta(\tau)=\tau$. Then we have \[T=\begin{bmatrix}
	e^{-\tau h} & \tau \\
	\tau & e^{\tau h}
	\end{bmatrix} \approx I_2-\tau\begin{bmatrix}
	h & -1 \\
	-1 & -h
	\end{bmatrix}.\] 
	From this it follows that \[H=\begin{bmatrix}
	h & -1 \\
	-1 & -h
	\end{bmatrix}=-\sigma_1+h\sigma_3, \] where $\sigma_1,\sigma_2$, and $\sigma_3$ are the Pauli matrices. 
	
	More generally, we can ask what constraints $\beta$ and $\beta_\tau$ must satisfy to be able to do this. 
	Analyzing each of the four matrix entries shows that for small $\tau$ we need 
	\[e^{-\beta h} \approx 1-\tau H_{0,0}, \quad e^{-2\beta_\tau} \approx -\tau H_{1,0}=-\tau H_{0,1},\quad \text{and} \ e^{\beta h} \approx 1- \tau H_{1,1}. \]
	
	Since $H_{1,0}$ and $H_{0,1}$ are constant with respect to $\tau$ we need $-2\beta_\tau \approx \log (\lambda\tau)$ for small $\tau$ and some $\lambda\in \R_{>0}$. 
	Similarly, if $\beta$ is small when $\tau$ is small we have $e^{-\beta h} \approx 1-\beta h \approx 1-\tau H_{0,0}$ and $e^{\beta h} \approx 1+\beta h \approx 1-\tau H_{1,1}$. 
	So to first order we have $\beta \approx \tau$ and we see $H_{0,0}=-H_{1,1}=\mu h$ for some $\mu \in \R\sm\{0\}$. 
	
	Putting all of this together, we see that the general $\tau$-continuum Hamiltonian for this model will have the form 
	\[ H=\begin{bmatrix}
	\mu h & -\lambda \\
	-\lambda & -\mu h
	\end{bmatrix}=-\lambda\sigma_1+\mu h\sigma_3.\]
	
	Now we could also attempt to find a second order approximation of $T$ so that $T\approx I - \tau H + \frac{1}{2}\tau^2 H^2$ for an operator $H$ not depending on $\tau$. 
	However, following the approach above will show us that there is no easy solution in this case.  
	To get a higher order approximation (or the actual matrix logarithm solving $T=e^{-\tau H}$ for $H$), we may need to allow $H$ to depend on $\tau$. 
	
	In the second order case, we need 
	\begin{align*}
		e^{-\beta h} &\approx 1- \tau H_{0,0}+\frac{\tau^2}{2}(H_{0,0}^2+H_{0,1}^2),\\
		e^{-2\beta_\tau} &\approx -\tau H_{0,1}+\frac{\tau^2}{2}(H_{0,0}H_{0,1}+H_{0,1}H_{1,1}),\\
		e^{\beta h} &\approx 1 - \tau H_{1,1}+\frac{\tau^2}{2}(H_{0,1}^2+H_{0,0}^2)
	\end{align*}
	for small $\tau$, where we have used the fact that $H$ should be real and symmetric and so $H_{0,1}=H_{1,0}$.
	From the first and third equations, we see that $H_{0,0}$ and $H_{1,1}$ must depend on $h$. 
	But the second equation has no dependence on $h$, so the dependence of $H_{0,1}$ on $h$ must be inversely related to the $H_{0,0}$ and $H_{1,1}$ dependence.
	On the other hand adding the first and third equations yields
	\[\cosh(\beta h) \approx 1-\frac{\tau}{2}( H_{0,0}+ H_{1,1})+\frac{\tau^2}{4}(H_{0,0}^2+2H_{0,1}^2+H_{1,1}^2), \]
	which naturally suggests  taking $\beta=\mu\tau$, $H_{0,0}=-H_{1,1}=\mu h$, and $H_{0,1}=H{1,0}=0$. But this is a contradiction.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{1+1 Ising Model}
	
	We may analyze the $1+1$ Ising model similarly to the $1+0$ model. 
	We are going to relate a statistical mechanics system on a 2-dimensional lattice (with one temporal and one spatial dimension) to a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian on a 1-dimensional system of interacting spins.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{Infinite Lattice Ising Models}
	
	The Ising model can be generalized to an \emph{infinite volume model} by letting the lattice $\cL$ grow to $\Z^d$ appropriately. 
	We'll briefly sketch the ideas here - a detailed exposition can be found in \cite{friedli_velenik_2017} in chapters 3 and 6. 
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\section{O(N) Model}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	These models are extensively treated in \cite{HamerKogutSusskind79} and \cite{FradkinSusskind78}. 
	As in the Ising model, we have a lattice $\cL \subset \Z^d$ of $M$ points, usually cubic. 
	The spins at each site $i$ of the lattice are now $\vec{x_i} \in \Omega_0=S^{N-1} = \{\vec{x} \in \R^{N} \mid \|\vec{x}\|=1 \}$. 
	The action is
	\[\mathcal{S}=\sum_{i,j} -J_{i,j}\vec{x_i}\cdot\vec{x_j}, \] where the sum is over nearest-neighbor pairs in $\cL$.
	Frequently we will take the interaction constants $J_{i,j}$ to depend only on which coordinate of the lattice the points differ in.
	As in the earlier examples, it may be helpful to renormalize the action so that when all the $\vec{x_i}$ are equal we get $\mathcal{S}=0$. 
	This results in a renormalized action
	\[\mathcal{S}=\sum_{i,j}\frac{1}{2} J_{i,j}(\vec{x_i}-\vec{x_j})^2. \]
	
	As before, we are interested in thinking of our $d$-dimensional lattice as having $1$ time dimension and $d-1$ spatial dimensions and finding a $\tau$-continuum quantum mechanical Hamiltonian $H$ that corresponds to the action as the lattice spacing $\tau$ goes to $0$.
	Since the spin configuration space is now continuous, the partition function will now be an integral rather than a summation:
	\[ Z=\int_{(S^N)^M} d\vec{x_1}\ldots d\vec{x_M} e^{-\beta\sum_{i,j}\frac{1}{2} J_{i,j}(\vec{x_i}-\vec{x_j})^2}. \]
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{O(2) model on a 1-dimensional lattice}
	
	First we consider the $O(2)$ model on a 1-dimensional lattice of $N$ points with periodic boundary conditions. When our configuration space is $S^1$, we can parameterize the spins $\vec{x_i}=(cos(\theta_i),\sin(\theta_i))$ for $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$. 
	Under this parameterization, the action becomes
	\[ \mathcal{S} = -J\sum_{j=1}^N \cos(\theta_j)\cos(\theta_{j+1})+\sin(\theta_j)\sin(\theta_{j+1}) 
	=  - J\sum_{j=1}^N \cos(\theta_j-\theta_{j+1}). \]
	
	The corresponding partition function is then
	\[ Z = \int_{[0,2\pi]^N} \left(\prod_{j=1}^N d\theta_j \right) e^{\sum_{j=1}^N\beta J \cos(\theta_j-\theta_{j+1})}, \]
	 where again $\beta=\frac{1}{kT}$ is the inverse temperature.
	
	We now wish find an analogue of the transfer matrix from the analysis of the Ising model.
